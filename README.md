## Common issues
- Q: It says "error" when I try to upload a subtitle or log-in
  - A: Opensubtitles' servers are probably down or temporarily unavailable. It happens. Try again in a few hours or a few days. Or contact OpenSubtitles directly, I'm not them.

- Q: The app says the subtitle is already in Opensubtitles, but it isn't
  - A: The application only communicates with Opensubtitles' servers. If they say it's already online, check with Opensubtitles directly, as this software does not provide support for Opensubtitles services themselves.

- Q: I have an error "The profile couln't be loaded" related to NW.js
  - A: Try deleting `%localappdata%\nwjs` and `%localappdata%\opensubtitles-uploader`.

- Q: I'm using Linux, where can I use the app?
  - A: I'm no longer actively maintaining linux builds due to limited time available. You can try to build the application yourself (see below how) and report on improvements/enhancements needed in order to ship those binaries as well in the future.

- Q: I'm using OSX, can I use the app?
  - A: You could try to build the OSX x64 (for Intel) and emulate it on Apple Silicon or try to build manually the app with the compatible nwjs binaries alongside node_modules and this repo files.
